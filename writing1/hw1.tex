\section{Processes, Threads and CPU Scheduling}

Processes, threads, and CPU Scheduling are parts of an operating system that define how the operating system functions. Different operating systems have different scheduling algorithms, and processes running on one operating system may behave differently on another operating system. In the following sections, I will examine the similarities and differences of these three components in Linux, FreeBSD, and Windows.

\subsection{Processes}

A process is often defined as a program in execution, or as an instance of running programs. Processes do not only include the program, but also the resources that are needed to run the program. The specific components of a process differ across operating systems; however, there are some properties of a process that are apparent across all operating systems.

Processes are represented by a large data structure called a Process Control Block. In Linux, processes are represented by the task\_struct data structure. Each new process is appended to a task vector, which has by default can hold up to a limit of 512 processes. In Windows, processes are defined in the EPROCESS block.  Linux, FreeBSD, and Windows all contain similar components in their process control blocks. They all include things such as a unique PID, the execution state, virtual address space, program code, program data, scheduling information, and system resources.

In Linux and FreeBSD, processes are created using the fork() and exec() calls, which creates a child process. This clones the current process, so that the child and parent process shares important resources. In Windows, the functional equivalent is CreateProcess(), which creates a new process but does not initialize a parent child relationship like Linux does. Because of this, child processes in Windows only store the PID of their parent process and no other information, and can continue running when a parent process is closed. In Linux, child processes tend to exit when the parent exits.
